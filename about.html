    <h1>Activity Pub Remote Follow</h1>
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        This service is meant to make it easier to follow people on
        ActivityPub instances through links online. This service allows
        users to have their local instance signup page a click away.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <p>
        ActivityPub instances uses something called <a href="https://webfinger.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer"
          target="_blank">webfinger</a> to
        find out information about a user, and the instance it's on. This service uses the webfinger protocol to resolve
        the target user's
        instance, if allowed by CORS, and gets the profile page and canonical account name from the webfinger response.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a canonical lookup of the webfinger endpoint is not possible (due to CORS), the service will attempt to infer
        a valid profile path from the
        provided account name itself. This is not guaranteed to work, but it's good enough as a fallback. The remote
        follow system will most likely still
        operate as normal.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first time someone gets linked to this service, they get asked to submit their own username. This service
        will in turn use
        webfinger to find out their follow link, and store it in the browsers local storage. This way, the next time
        someone clicks on
        a link to this service, they will be able to follow the target user instantly.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h2>What about privacy?</h2>
      <p>
        While this service DOES store the template path in the browser's local storage, it does not store any
        information about the
        target user. The path stored generally looks like this
        <code>https://instance.url/authorize_interaction?uri={uri}</code> and
        is used to redirect the user to their local instance's follow page.
      </p>
      <p>
        This service is hosted on GitHub Pages, and is completely static. No data is collected by me, and since I've
        opted to use url-hashes
        for the user links, not even the username is sent to the server. So GitHub cannot see who being followed using
        this service,
        nor the username of who is following.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the follow-template is stored in local storage, that also never leaves the user's browser. Although,
        browser will run
        any JavaScript on the page, so while you can make sure that it does what I claim today, it could potentially
        leak your follow template
        in the future. But since your username is not sent to the server, at most what could be leaked with the current
        source code is which instance
        you're on.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know internet privacy is a big deal for many, and I've tried to make the follow page where potentially
        sensitive information is managed
        as transparent as possible. No javascript framework or minified code. Not even external javascript resources.
        It's all in the HTML in a script tag.
        Commented and raw, in an effort to make it as trivial as possible to vet and audit the code that is actually
        executed.
      </p>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Do I need to authorize or anything?</h2>
      <p>
        No. This service does not require any authorization. It does not even require you to be logged in to your
        instance. It's just a
        simple redirect to your instance's follow page. The only thing you need to do is to make sure that you have a
        valid username on your
        instance. It doesn't even have to be your own username, since the follow-endpoint is not tied to any specific
        user.
